### TO INSTALL PACKAGE FOR ASSIGNMENT 

1. Set up environment variables for ROS. Make sure to replace '/home/rpi/shared' with your own shared folder location
<pre>
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
</pre>
Also do any Windows or Mac specific setup

For example in Mac...
<pre>
export WEBOTS_HOME=/Applications/Webots.app
python3 local_simulation_server.py
</pre>

For example in windows...
<pre>
export WEBOTS_HOME=/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Webots
</pre>

2. Fork your own repository of f23_robotics (using web interface)

3. Clone your fork
<pre>
git clone <your github url for this repository>
</pre>

4. Make the package (for python, it really just installs the files
<pre>
cd f24_robotics
colcon build
</pre>

5. Set up variables to use the package you just created
<pre>
source install/setup.bash
</pre>

6. Start webots simulation with connect back to ROS in the virtual machine
<pre>
ros2 launch webots_ros2_homework1_python f23_robotics_1_launch.py
</pre>

### RUN CONTROLLER
For logging purposes set SPAWN and TRIAL constants to properly log files. If introducing a new spawn, create a directory inside of "f24_robotics/trials" titled, spawn_{SPAWN_POINT}. A .trial file with the trials cordinates will be saved here upon the first manual interupt (ctrl-c) of the controller.
<pre>
ros2 run webots_ros2_homework1_python webots_ros2_homework1_python
</pre>

### PLOT PATHS
Set SPAWN_POINT to the spawn you want to plot, and set MIN_TRIAL and MAX_TRIAL to the first and last trial you would like included in the image. This will generate a file called "robot_paths_{SPAWN_POINT}.png"
<pre>
python3 plot_paths.py
</pre>
